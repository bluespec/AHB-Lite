= AHB Lite Master for TCM-based Near-Mems

This repository has been repurposed from AHB-Lite sources in `Bluespec_RISCV` for use with a TCM based near-mem (only supports single requests).

While the repository does support standalone testing of the master with a memory model attached to a AHB-Lite slave, it is meant to be eventually used as an adapter with a `Near_Mem_TCM` implementation.
