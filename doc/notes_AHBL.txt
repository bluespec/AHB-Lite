  "AMBA 3 AHB-Lite Protocol v1.0; Specification",
   Document IHI 0033A, ARM Ltd., 2006

These notes are based on studying the document.

AHB-Lite (and AHB) is quite complex (compared to AXI4-Lite) because it
is not truly pipelined. It has a strange coupling between address and
data transfer: a second address transfer cannot be completed until the
first data transfer is completed.  The document is also quite poorly
written

- HADDR: is not flow controlled AT ALL.
    The Master can issue an addr on any cycle.

    p1-5: "A slave cannot request that the address phase is extended
    and therefore all slaves must be capable of sampling the address
    during this time."

    Master can _always_ provide next addr during a data xfer (assuming HREADY)

    p3-2: Address phase lasts for a single HCLK (unless extended by previous xfer)

    During a data-phase xfer, only HTRANS=IDLE indicates that the address is bogus.

    When ! HREADY, master must not change HADDR etc.
    i.e., master must hold HADDR etc. until next HREADY

- HTRANS:
    In general, HTRANS=BUSY can mean that the WDATA is not yet available for
    the master to send.  But this can never happen in a transactor
    from AXI4 master to AHBL master, since WR_DATA is needed even for
    the address phase, since AHBL.HSIZE has to be computed from
    AXI4L.WR_DATA.WSTRB.  Thus, WDATA is always available.

    However, HTRANS _can_ be BUSY for other reasons: if the
    AXI4L.WR_RESP or AXI4L.RD_DATA channels are blocked, the master is
    unable to accept the AHBL slave response.

- HREADYOUT: is _only_ used (by slave) to wait-state the data transfer,
    never an address phase. In fact 'wait-state' _only_ refers to data
    xfer.

    HREADY from multiplexor high => completion of data transfer.
        but also sent from multiplexor to all slaves via their HREADYIN ports.

    p4-2: "when HREADY is HIGH, indicating that the current transfer is completing"
        But, if master has asserted HTRANS=BUSY, the transfer is not yet completing.
	Timing diagram p3-6 shows example of HREADY HIGH but HTRANS=BUSY.

- HRESP can only depend on HADDR (misalignment, bad size, out of
    range, ...), since it is provided on the same cycle as HWDATA/HRDATA.

    Table 3-1: "Slaves must always provide a zero wait state OKAY for BUSY xfers,
        and the xfer must be ignored by the slave"

- After all this analysis, it appears that:
    - In Master, generating HTRANS cannot depend on input HREADY
    - In Slave,  generating HREADY cannot depend on input HTRANS

- HSELx: p2-6: 'HSELx is a combinatorial decode of the address bus' (in the decoder)
        'HSELx signals to the multiplexor should be retimed to the data phase'
    i.e., the HSELx provided to the multiplexor needs 1 cycle behind
    the HSELx provided to slaves.

- HMASTLOCK is irrelevant for single-master structures. It would only
    be used in a 'Multi-layer AHB' structure. When one master asserts
    HMASTLOCK during one HADDR phase , the multi-layer arbiter will
    have to hold that arbitration until the next HADDR phase.

    - Presumably HMASTLOCK is only used on SINGLE transactions (would be
        quite hairy if it applied to any kind of burst!).
